                        Lohri is a popular Punjabi festival celebrated in the northern regions of India, particularly in Punjab. It marks the end of winter and the arrival of longer days, symbolizing the harvest of the Rabi crops, especially sugarcane. The festival is characterized by lively bonfires around which people gather to sing, dance, and celebrate. Traditional foods like sesame seeds, jaggery, and popcorn are offered to the fire as part of the rituals. Lohri is a time for community gathering and joyous festivities, reflecting the agricultural heritage and cultural vibrancy of Punjab.
